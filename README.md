# COVID-19-RNA-Sequences-Analysis
Analysis of COVID-19 sequences in different Variants of the COVID-19 Virus.

RNA Overview:

RNA is the 'sourcecode' of the virus, that enables the virus to enter a cell and replicate itself. This sourcecode is the mechanism that allows the virus repplicatoin. Unlike DNA in humans, RNA only has one strand of sugar-phosphates and has a slighlty different sequence of nucleotides that make it up.

The data in this project is taken from the NIH (National Institutes of Health) a US federal organizartion, which sequences DNA and RNA and stores the data in a searchable database. 

The data set is included in this repository.
